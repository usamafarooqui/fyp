    question: `Why aren't the due diligence reports included with the free
    membership?`,
    answer: `Because we invest a lot of time, resources and money into ensuring
    we deliver the best and most detailed due diligence reports in the
    industry. Other marketplaces/brokers don’t give you the level of
    actionable insight like we do, and if they did, we can guarantee you
    they won’t come free. Some brokers charge thousands of dollars for a
    single report on one listing. You’re getting unlimited access either
    for a lifetime one-off cost or a small monthly subscription.`,

    question: `I have no experience of due diligence at all. Is this membership
    right for me?`,
    answer: ` Of course, the Premium membership is perfect for you. We show you
    everything we look for in an online business. Not only do we take a
    deeper dive into our listings, we also give you recommended
    strategies you can implement in order to fulfil a site’s earnings
    potential.`,

    question: ` I already know how to evaluate listings on Investors Club. Why
    should I use your due diligence?`,
    answer: `Because we’ve already done it for you, so you don’t have to. We know
    how time consuming and repetitive it is to constantly sift through
    listings. Furthermore, to do it at scale requires an extra set of
    hands. Many investors don’t have the time or the resources to do it. That’s why we decided our team will go the extra mile unlike other
    lazy brokers who simply just list businesses and expect you to still
    do all of the work.`,
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: `Can non-Premium members get access to the listings?`,
    answer: ` As a Guest member, you will be able to see only the basic
    information about listings (price, revenue, multiple, monetization
    methods…). Everything else we cover in the due diligence reports
    will be redacted. You’ll need to upgrade your account to get
    unlimited and unrestricted access across all listings.`,
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: `How often will you publish new listings?`,
    answer: ` We always have a solid volume of sites in our deal flow. You can
    expect sites to be published regularly throughout the week, every
    week.`,
  },

    question: `What can I expect in the Discord channel?`,
    answer: ` We believe the best way to get ahead and fast-track your business
    success is by surrounding yourself with the right people. Our
    private Discord community consists of some of the top investors and
    SEO entrepreneurs in the industry. It’s a place for you to hangout,
    network, learn/share knowledge and connect with like minded people
    in a more intimate setting and more importantly, in real time.
    Furthermore, the priority support that comes with the Premium
    membership is delivered through our Discord server.`,

    question: `What is the Deals Concierge service?`,
    answer: ` Deals Concierge is an end-to-end managed service. We privately
    source 3-5 deals that fit the size, niche, monetization method, and
    other critical factors you look for. As a Premium member, you get a
    lifetime discount of 10% off our original packages. That’s a saving
    of up to $1,400. All private deals we source for you also come with
    our due diligence reports as part of the package.`,

    question: `What is your Operator Service?`,
    answer: ` While browsing our listings, you'll notice many of them are eligible
    for our Operator Service, Buzz Logic. This means our analysts have
    indicated that the website being listed for sale could be a great
    opportunity for the prospective buyer to work with Buzz Logic to
    help manage and implement the growth strategies highlighted in our
    due diligence. Many of our clients choose this option as it means
    they can sit back and watch us grow their site, and ultimately
    increase their ROI. However, this is an optional service not
    included in the asking price. There are additional ongoing fees.`,
